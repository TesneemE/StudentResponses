Medicine: I've always been interested in medicine because it directly helps people in their daily lives by preventing or treating illnesses. I also admire the dedication of doctors.
- Computer Electronics: As technology develops rapidly, it begins to play a much larger role in our daily lives. I find it astonishing just how reliant we are on technology, from how we travel to how we work. 
- Prosthetics: This is a bit of a more detailed topic and may fall under the category of medicine, but I've always felt connected to this topic because my father uses hearing aids—a form of prosthesis. The fact that an artificial device can alleviate most of the burden that disabled folks go through is wonderful, but it's a shame that most prosthetics are too expensive.",Caroline Creary

During Covid as well, I was active on Scratch, a coding platform, and often joined 'mall' communities in which users could make their own shops for products as well as buy products to use in their personal projects.

If it is a concept I am not familiar with, I often go to the internet and search it up to learn something new. 
For example, I decided to pick up a Jane Austen book, Pride and Prejudice, this summer to read. It has been very interesting, but the written language is complicated and full of words that I am not familiar with, or that have evolved to have a different meaning in our day and age. When I come across sentences like these, I pause and read it again a few times, trying to define/phrases the words I don't know or using context. An online dictionary or a google search is often very helpful in cases like these. I then try and apply that newly learned information in another scenario to further understand it.",Tochukwu Ugboajah
Give an example of a problem you've solved recently. How did you go about solving it?,"I am a person that tends to try and customize the appearance of her phone. Recently, I wanted to try customizing my iPhone, which I hadn't done before and had only done on Android. I was looking for icon packs, but couldn't find ones that I liked, so I decided to try and make my own. One of the biggest problems in doing so was finding app URL schemes, and finding a web host for the files.
Icon packs usually are groups of web clips on a configuration file, each with a custom icon and redirection to the app you want to open. You have to make an html file for each app, with code that after clicking on the web clip results in opening up the app you want. In each html file contains the url scheme for the app you want to open. Finding url schemes takes A LOT of work, especially because they are not too easily accessible to users, and the ones found online can be outdated. Eventually after a lot of researching I was able to find an updated directory with creditable url schemes for many apps.
After making a folder with all your html files and their matching icons in an image format, you also need to find a web host so that when the web clip is clicked, it opens to that host, and runs the html file which is stored on the host. Github would have been the simplest option, but I did not know how to use it at all, so I looked for other options. Many free website hosts/makers cost money, but I eventually found a free host after research of sites for different uses/capabilities. Throughout the whole process I ran into a lot of problems but with additional work and research, I was able to create the icon pack! It wasn't perfect, but it worked.",Tochukwu Ugboajah
