"Please write 2-3 sentences (you are welcome to write more if you'd like) answering the questions below. When you're trying to learn something new or answer a complex question, what steps do you take?","If I have no previous knowledge on the subject, I’ll research to identify what subject the question is about, and then learn the skills needed to solve those types of problems, they tend to stick the more I solve them. The amount of steps I take depends on how complex the problem might be, and if the problem spans across multiple subjects, then I’m not sure, but I think I’d try breaking it off into more manageable chunks rather than tackling it all at once."
Give an example of a problem you've solved recently.

To my surprise, there was a TD bank right outside the building, where I managed to take out money without my psychical credit card present. Definetly some problem solving there, and my first solution wasn’t even close to achieving what I needed (which was cash ASAP). So, never use your first solution, because you can probably do better."
"Can you share a time when you worked with others on a project? What role did you play, and what did you learn from the experience?","I worked on an aspects presentation with four people, but inevitably I think our problem was that we lacked the organization needed to give each of us an adequate distribution of the workload, because we spent most of our inperson time struggling to arrange a draft of an outline for the final presentation (we had a day to do it). My friend and I ended up doing a huge chunk of the work really late, because nobody was working on it! I think what I learned was 1. you can really only hold people accountable best in person. 2. Manage your time effectively in person so that you can work effectively independently. 3. Assign clear work goals so everyone knows what they’re supposed to do."
