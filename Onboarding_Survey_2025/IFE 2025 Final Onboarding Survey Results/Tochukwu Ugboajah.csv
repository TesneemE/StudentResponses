"In 2-3 sentences, describe your experience with entrepreneurial activities. If you have no prior entrepreneurial experience, please explain what draws you to entrepreneurship.","When I was in elementary school, I started (or tried to) a jewelry business with rainbow loom rubber bands. I would make bracelets, rings, and other things and sell them to my friends for a few bucks. Only made a few sales and ended up giving most of my 'stock' away for free, but it was an interesting try. 
During Covid as well, I was active on Scratch, a coding platform, and often joined 'mall' communities in which users could make their own shops for products as well as buy products to use in their personal projects. I wouldn't say it was a real business, per say, but I had a shop of my own and was making products and trading them for some kind of online currency that I could then use to buy from other shops. There were forums built just for transactions to confirm that users paid!"

"Please write 2-3 sentences (you are welcome to write more if you'd like) answering the questions below. When you're trying to learn something new or answer a complex question, what steps do you take?","I try breaking down the question first and see if I can understand/answer it with my own knowledge. If it is a concept I am not familiar with, I often go to the internet and search it up to learn something new. 
For example, I decided to pick up a Jane Austen book, Pride and Prejudice, this summer to read. It has been very interesting, but the written language is complicated and full of words that I am not familiar with, or that have evolved to have a different meaning in our day and age. When I come across sentences like these, I pause and read it again a few times, trying to define/phrases the words I don't know or using context. An online dictionary or a google search is often very helpful in cases like these. I then try and apply that newly learned information in another scenario to further understand it."
Give an example of a problem you've solved recently. How did you go about solving it?,"I am a person that tends to try and customize the appearance of her phone. Recently, I wanted to try customizing my iPhone, which I hadn't done before and had only done on Android. I was looking for icon packs, but couldn't find ones that I liked, so I decided to try and make my own. One of the biggest problems in doing so was finding app URL schemes, and finding a web host for the files.
Icon packs usually are groups of web clips on a configuration file, each with a custom icon and redirection to the app you want to open. You have to make an html file for each app, with code that after clicking on the web clip results in opening up the app you want. In each html file contains the url scheme for the app you want to open. Finding url schemes takes A LOT of work, especially because they are not too easily accessible to users, and the ones found online can be outdated. Eventually after a lot of researching I was able to find an updated directory with creditable url schemes for many apps.
After making a folder with all your html files and their matching icons in an image format, you also need to find a web host so that when the web clip is clicked, it opens to that host, and runs the html file which is stored on the host. Github would have been the simplest option, but I did not know how to use it at all, so I looked for other options. Many free website hosts/makers cost money, but I eventually found a free host after research of sites for different uses/capabilities. Throughout the whole process I ran into a lot of problems but with additional work and research, I was able to create the icon pack! It wasn't perfect, but it worked."
"Can you share a time when you worked with others on a project? What role did you play, and what did you learn from the experience?","I worked with a group in my history class around two months ago to create a presentation based on a topic. We had to assign a group leader, who would check over progress and split work while also doing their part. I was chosen as the leader, and my team and I were able to work well together to create a good and informative presentation. I learned not only from this but other experiences working in a group that while I can have a short temper, it further motivates me to get my part done and push others to put in their best work as well."

Write down at least 3 different industries you are interested in or curious about. What makes it interesting?,"I am interested in tech/computer science, fashion/retail, finance, and beauty. Computer science, because I have always had an interest in things tech and programming. We are in the age of tech and internet now, but being able to dive into and understand the components that make up our everyday tech and internet is such a engaging topic of learning. Fashion and retail, I've always loved all things clothes and being able to express oneself through outward appearance. The amount of creativity found in this area alone is so inspiring and can truly almost never get boring. When I was younger, I really wanted to be a fashion designer. Beauty, I just think that the beauty industry is one that can be very profitable, and is in interest of many, many girls and women including me. Working to formulate products that users can use for their benefit and enhancement, that's both a way to solve many problems and nurture one's passion. As for finance, money is a very interesting topic and industry as well.
