In the United States 92 million tons of clothing materials are discarded into landfills annually, which causes high amounts of CO2 to be released. Many Fast Fashion brands cause these overflowing landfills, by producing too much clothes that are often quickly thrown away after trends die down. Additionally, through many of these fast fashion companies, such as SHEIN, there is an unimaginable amount of slavery and child labor that goes into these pieces. The high demand for cheap clothing with fast-paced turn over has caused many parts of the supply chain to look for slave labor in a bid to keep up with the demand.Many websites strive to solve this issue like Depop, Mercari, etc. However, many people become inherently greedy and upcharge the cost of their clothing, contradicting the meer meaning of affordable second hand clothing. Not to mention, thrift stores have nearly been as expensive as regular retail stores, a grotesque product of capitalism.",,,,,

Initially, I struggled with communicating effectively with people I once thought were beyond my reach. However, this program has given me the confidence to engage meaningfully and express my ideas clearly in both personal and professional settings. The challenges faced have also taught me the power of persistence, showing me that resilience is crucial for overcoming obstacles and achieving success. Additionally, the program has fostered an entrepreneurial mindset, providing insights and practical experience that have clarified my career aspirations. One of the most significant impacts has been on my perspective regarding environmental issues; extensive research on climate change has heightened my concern for the environment and motivated me to advocate for sustainability. I have experienced substantial personal growth, evolving from struggling to explain my ideas to my teammates to confidently presenting them to an entire room of people. This improvement in communication and presentation skills will undoubtedly enhance my future work performance and influence my mindset. Overall, the program has profoundly enriched my understanding of both myself and the world around me.
